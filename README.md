Rick&Morty App it`s a personal project where you can make a list of 'Rick and Morty
'`s characters. You can add each one of them to favorites section and filter by gender.

To add a new character, you have to write a number from 1 to 826. You can
press the 'random' button to choose a random one.

For logging, you must write an email(doesn't have to be real)
and an eight long password with numbers, at least a capital letter and
lower cases.For example:

       email:optimusPrime@gmail.com
       Password:123456Fa
   Warning:Do not use especial caracters($,@,#, etc...) for the password
